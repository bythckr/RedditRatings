        <p>RedditReviewBot is a 3rd party reddit app that allows redditors to create Community Reviews of anything by commenting on reddit posts using a specific review format. Here is how it works:</p>

        <h3>1. Create a review thread using the [Community Review] tag</h3>
       
        <p>A thread is posted on reddit specifiying what is being reviewed and provides instructions on how to contribute a review.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, the [Community Review] tag has no functionality except to create an association between the tag and Community Reviews.</p>

        <h3>2. Redditors submit reviews by leaving comments</h3>
       
        <p>Using a specified format, redditors can leave a review in the comment section of the thread. Reviews consist of a Rating (1 to 10, integers only) and a Review.</p>
        
        <p><strong>This is the format for leaving a review in the comments section:</strong></p>

        <div class="review-format">
            
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> [Provide a rating from 1 to 10 here, integers only, required]</p>

            <p><strong>Rating:</strong></p>
            
            <p>[Write your review here, keep it short &amp; focus on your experience, optional]</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>If you want to say something in your comment that is not part of your review, use a horizontal rule ("---") to divide your review from your non-review comments.</p>
            
        </div>

        <h3>3. /u/RedditReviewBot scans for comments and pulls reviews into a database</h3>
        <p>The user reviews are aggregated by a crawler script to create the Community Review. The Community Review is displayed on this website and features an average rating, recommendation results, and the top user reviews (based on reddit score).</p>
