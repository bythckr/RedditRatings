    <p>{{ config['APP_NAME'] }} is a 3rd party reddit app that enables redditors to rate things together and then archives those ratings on this website.</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of the {{ config['APP_NAME'] }} app is to enable subreddits to create a more advanced type of content together. {{ config['APP_NAME'] }} helps subreddits express their collective opinion in the form of an average rating. This helps the subreddit communicate among themselves and to others outside of the community.</p>

    <p>{{ config['APP_NAME'] }} is a <a href="http://groupsrc.com" target="_blank">GroupSRC</a> project. GroupSRC was started by brothers <a href="http://twitter.com/daviddigiovanni" target="_blank">David DiGiovanni</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pauliedigi" target="_blank">Paul DiGiovanni</a> to explore how technology can help crowds communicate more effectively. We believe reddit makes crowds smarter and want to develop tools that expand the reddit platform.</p>
