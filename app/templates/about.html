        <p>RedditReviewBot is a 3rd party reddit app that allows redditors to create Community Reviews of anything by commenting on reddit posts using a specific review format.</p>

        <p>RedditReviewBot was created as a <a href="http://groupsrc.com" target="_blank">GroupSRC.com</a> project. GroupSRC was started by brothers <a href="http://twitter.com/daviddigiovanni" target="_blank">David DiGiovanni</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pauliedigi" target="_blank">Paul DiGiovanni</a> to explore the possibilities of reddit to help crowds communicate more effectively.</p>

        <p>RedditReviewBot fits into the GroupSRC mission by allowing reddit communities to create content together and articulate their opinions collectively by creating Community Reviews. At its core, RedditReviewBot is a database of reviews curated by reddit communities.</a>

        <p><strong>RedditReviewBot demonstrates a interesting potential for communities that utilize reddit as a platform for discussion. Reviewing things is just one way a community can create content together. What other types of content curation systems can be bolted onto the reddit interface?</strong></p>
