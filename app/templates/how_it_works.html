    <p>{{ config['APP_NAME'] }} is a 3rd party reddit app that enables subreddits to rate things together and then archives the ratings on this website. Here is how it works:</p>

        <h3>1. Create a "rating thread" on reddit</h3>
       
        <p>The rating thread presents something to be rated by the community and instruct users on how to submit a rating in the comments. Soon, you will be able to create your own rating threads from this website.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Redditors submit ratings by leaving comments</h3>
       
        <p>Using a specified format, redditors can leave a rating in the comment section of the thread. Ratings consist of a Rating and an optional Comment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>This is the format for leaving a rating in the comments section:</strong></p>

        <div class="review-format well">
            
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong>[  Provide a rating from 1 to 10 here, integers only, required</p>

            <p><strong>Comment:</strong></p>
            
            <p>Include any comments related to your rating here, encouraged but optional</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>If you want to say something not directly related to your rating, put it below a horizontal rule ('---').</p>
            
            <p>verifyrating</p>

            <p>If the text "verifyrating" is included, then a PM will be sent to you when your rating is parsed.</p>
            
        </div>

        <h3>3. /u/{{ config['APP_NAME'] }} catalogs the rating thread and calculates an average rating</h3>
        <p>A crawler script aggregates the user ratings into a single "Community Rating". The Community Rating is cataloged on this website and features an average rating and other relevant information about the Community Rating.</p>
